# PandaBase-Application-Crowd-Control-Feature-Development
A fake application feature development project based on a problem that I encountered when participating in Dig In Business Case Competition.  
• Define the problem statement from the case and develop a solution.  
• Created the product feature development roadmap plan. 
• Created the prototype of the new feature using figma. 
• Created the user flow of the new feature.
